# Bold Portfolio (static, GitHub Pages ready)

A colorful, animated portfolio inspired by R/m's playful aesthetic.  
Stack: **HTML + CSS + GSAP (ScrollTrigger)** — no build step required.

## Quick start
1. Download the ZIP in this folder.
2. Unzip and open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Replace images in `/assets` and update copy.
4. Commit to a GitHub repo and enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from main branch**.

## Customize
- Colors live in `:root` CSS variables (`styles.css`).
- Edit sections in `index.html` and animations in `script.js`.
- Swap the placeholder images (`assets/sample*.webp`) with your work.
- Want more spice? Explore GSAP effects (scrubbing timelines, pinned sections, text split, etc.).

## Notes
- The page stays totally static; GSAP is pulled from a CDN.
- Works great on GitHub Pages/Netlify/Cloudflare Pages.
